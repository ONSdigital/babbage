# Babbage

Repository for ONS Website Babbage

Babbage is a bespoke service for translating JSON into HTML. The Zebedee-Reader reads .json files off the server for passing to Babbage. Babbage then translates them into the .html files that are used in the website.

Babbage contains two main areas of functionality, as follows:

1. It creates the HTML files for the pages on the website.
2. It creates the HTML files for the website publications in the publishing system [Florence](https://github.com/ONSdigital/florence)

## Getting started

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

1. Java 8 (temurin builds are recommended):

   ```shell
   brew install temurin@8
   ```

1. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed:

   ```shell
   brew install nvm
   ```

   :warning: Make sure to follow the instructions provided at the end of the install to configure up your shell profile.

1. The node version specified in [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc) installed through nvm:

   ```shell
   nvm install
   ```

In order to run babbage locally:

* To run Babbage for the website functionality use this command

  ```shell
  make debug-web
  ```

* To run Babbage for the publishing functionality use this command

  ```shell
  make debug-publishing
  ```

* Babbage runs on port :8080

### Dependencies

Babbage runs independently. However, it requires other services to run in web and publishing mode. There are stacks that can be used in `dp-compose`

* In order to run it locally, with the other required services;
  * For web mode use: [homepage-web](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-compose/tree/main/v2/stacks/homepage-web)
  * For publishing mode use: [homepage publishing](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-compose/tree/main/v2/stacks/homepage-publishing)

#### DEPRECATION_CONFIG

The variable DEPRECATION_CONFIG consists of a json argument to the following schema:

```yaml
DEPRECATION_CONFIG:
  type: array
  description: "An array of path patterns to be deprecated"
  items:
    type: object
    description: "An individual path pattern to be deprecated"
    properties:
      deprecationDate:
        type: string
        description: "The date in which the decision was made to deprecate the path pattern. This should be in ISO_DATE_TIME format."
        format: date-time
        example: "2011-11-30T23:59:59"
      deprecationLink:
        description: "A url to further information of the deprecation of the path pattern"
        type: string
        example: "https://developer.ons.gov.uk/retirement/"
      sunsetDate:
        type: string
        description: "The date of when this path pattern will cease to return data on its endpoints and instead return blanket 404 status codes. This should be in ISO_DATE_TIME format"
        format: date-time
        example: "2011-12-25T23:59:59"
      matchPattern:
        type: string
        description: "A regex string pattern to match against requests"
```

For example:

```json
[
  {
    "deprecationDate": "2011-11-30T23:59:59",
    "deprecationLink": "https://developer.ons.gov.uk/retirement/",
    "sunsetDate": "2011-12-25T23:59:59",
    "matchPattern": "^/timeseriestool/data$"
  }
]
```

This would then be provided as an environment variable like so (ensuring quotes have been escaped):

```sh
export DEPRECATION_CONFIG='[{"deprecationDate":"2011-11-30T23:59:59", "sunsetDate":"2011-12-25T23:59:59", "link":"https://developer.ons.gov.uk/retirement/", "matchPattern":"^/timeseriestool/data$"}]'
```

For the purposes of our configuration this would need to be double escaped like so:

```json
{
  //...json,
  "DEPRECATION_CONFIG":"[{\\\"deprecationDate\\\":\\\"2011-11-30T23:59:59\\\", \\\"sunsetDate\\\":\\\"2011-12-25T23:59:59\\\", \\\"link\\\":\\\"https://developer.ons.gov.uk/retirement/\\\", \\\"matchPattern\\\":\\\"^/timeseriestool/data$\\\"}]"
  //...more json,
}
```

### Debugging

When Babbage is run using one of its scripts (either run.sh or run-publishing.sh) it incorporates a Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP).

To create the configuration in Intellij, for calling the JDWP debugger, do as follows:

* Choose Run --> Edit Configurations...
* Click the + to create a new configuration
* For the type of configuration select either 'Remote' or 'Remote JVM' (whichever option it gives you)
* Give the new configuration a name e.g. Babbage Remote
* For 'Debugger mode' choose 'Attach to remote JVM'
* For 'Host' enter: localhost
* For 'Port' enter the port number given in the relevant script (e.g. for run-publishing.sh it's 8000)
* Intellij should automatically complete the command line arguments (note that these are similar to the jdwp arguments in the relevant script):

  -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:8000

Then, to run and debug Babbage just do the following:

* At the command line, run the relevant script E.g.,
cd babbage
./run-publishing.sh

* Then in Intellij:
* Open babbage and add any breakpoints required
* Choose Run --> Debug 'Babbage Remote'

### Testing

To run unit tests:

`make test`

There is also a [guide for regression testing](REGRESSION.md). This is not complete and should not be seen as definitive.
