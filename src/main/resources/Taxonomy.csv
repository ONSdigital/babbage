,Retail Industry,,"The Retail industry is the sale of goods and services from individuals or businesses to the end-user. Retailers are part of an integrated system called the supply chain. A retailer purchases goods or products in large quantities from manufacturers directly or through a wholesale, and then sells smaller quantities to the consumer for a profit. Retailing can be done in either fixed locations like stores or markets, door-to-door or by delivery.",

Economy,,,"An economy or economic system consists of the production, distribution or trade, and consumption of limited goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. The economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency.",
,Gross Domestic Product (GDP),,"Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of economic activity which captures the value of goods and services that the UK produces during a given period. GDP can be expressed in nominal or real terms. Nominal GDP reflects the value of all the goods and services which are produced in the UK during a given period, using their price at the time of production.","Real GDP also reflects the value of produced goods and services, but it uses constant consumer and producer price indices to remove the effects of rising price levels (inflation). Periods of real GDP growth are thought to enhance the welfare of individuals as economic growth allows average incomes to rise, supporting a higher level of consumption. Periods of negative real GDP growth are associated with lower incomes, lower consumption and consequently a lower standard of living."
,Inflation and Price Indices,,Consumer price inflation is the speed at which the prices of goods and services bought by households rise or fall. Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. One way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. ONS consumer price indices are published monthly.,"A price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to September 2014, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between September 2013 and September 2014. ONS publishes a range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation. A tale of many price indices summarises information on the different measures."
,National Accounts,,"The national accounts provide an integrated description of all economic activity within the economic territory of the UK, including activity involving both domestic units (i.e. individuals and institutions resident in the UK) and external units (those resident in other countries). In addition to being comprehensive, the accounts are fully integrated and internally consistent.","The majority of the core accounts deal with transactions between the various sectors of the economy, such as corporations, households and government, as well as transactions with the rest of the world."
,"Government, Public Sector and Taxes",,"Government, Public Sector and Taxes covers the latest figures for what the UK public sector has raised in revenue,spent and invested. The headline statistic is for Public Sector Net Borrowing which is a measure of the amount of money the Government has had to borrow in order to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue. The other key statistics are Surplus on Current Budget and Public Sector Net Debt.",

,Gross Value Added (GVA),,"Gross Value Added (GVA) measures the contribution to the economy of each individual producer, industry or sector in the United Kingdom. It is used in the estimation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is a key indicator of the state of the whole economy. In the UK, three theoretical approaches are used to estimate GDP: 'production', 'income' and 'expenditure'. When using the production or income approaches, the contribution to the economy of each industry or sector is measured using GVA.",

,Regional Accounts,,,
,Environmental Accounts,,"Environmental accounts show how the environment contributes to the economy, the impacts that the economy has on the environment, and how society responds to environmental issues. They include natural capital accounts (oil and gas), physical accounts (fuel use, energy consumption, atmospheric emissions, material flows, and water), and monetary accounts (environmental taxes and environmental protection expenditure). For 2014, experimental natural capital accounts (land use and forestry) are also included.",
Employment and Labour Market,,,"Labour market statistics measure many different aspects of work and jobs and provide an insight into the economy. They are also very much about people, including their participation in the labour force, the types of work they do, the earnings and benefits they receive and their working patterns. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has developed a framework for labour market statistics to describe the major concepts that exist within the labour market and their relationship to each other.",

"People, Population and Community",,,"People, population and community statistics are the use of statistical measurement systems to study human behavior in a social environment. This can be accomplished through polling a group of people, evaluating a subset of data obtained about a group of people, or by observation and statistical analysis of a set of data that relates to people and their behaviors.",
,Population and Migration,,"Population and migration statistics have a wide range of uses; they are used by central and local government and the health sector for planning and monitoring policy and service delivery; resource allocation; and managing the economy. Additionally, they are used by a wider range of organisations such as commercial companies for market research, special interest groups and academia as well as being of interest to the general public.",
,,Population Estimates,"ONS estimates annually the size of the “usually resident population” at the mid-year point (30 June). This is the population who have been usually resident for a period of at least 12 months, or, if they have been resident for less than this period, intend to stay for at least 12 months in total.  Visitors and short term immigrants are not included, but usual residents of the UK temporarily visiting another country are included.",
,,International Migration,"International migration statistics provide estimates of the number of usual residents moving in or out of the UK. This set of statistics is probably the one most quoted when discussing international migration. They include only those intending to change their place of usual residence for 12 months or more, thus long-term immigrants are added to and emigrants are subtracted from the estimate of usual residents of the UK.",
,,Population Projections,"Population projections are based on mid-year population estimates and a set of underlying assumptions regarding future fertility, mortality and migration. They are not forecasts and do not attempt to predict the impact that current and future government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors might have on demographic behaviour, for example, government policies on immigration, student fees, or local house-building policies.",
,,Migration within the UK,Internal migration estimates by Local Authority measure the flow of usual residents around the UK by age and sex.  They are published annually and are used as components of change in Local Authority population estimates and projections.,
,"Births, Deaths and Marriages",,"Births, deaths and marriages or ‘life event’ statistics contribute to the understanding of the size and condition of the population.  The number of births and deaths affect the size of the usual resident population.  Definitive data on the number of births and deaths are published on a calendar year basis, whereas data for updating population estimates use mid-year to mid-year (1 July to 30 June) data, with some other minor differences.",

,Well-being,,"Measuring National Well-being is about looking at 'GDP and beyond'. It includes headline indicators in areas such as as health, relationships, education and skills, what we do, where we live, our finances, the economy, governance, the environment and measures of 'personal well-being' (individuals' assessment of their own well-being).",
