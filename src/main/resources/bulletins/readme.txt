How to create a bulletin for the Alpha website

Copy one of the existing files in this folder and edit it.

The header values you can use are:

Theme  : Economy
Level 2: Government, Public Sector and Taxes
Level 3: Public Sector Finance
Lede: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
More: Sit autem paulo necessitatibus an, eu case
Summary: Displayed in the boxes on other pages leading to the bulletin
Headline 1: Displayed on T3 pages
Headline 2: Displayed on T3 pages
Headline 3: Displayed on T3 pages
Contact name: Displayed on bulletin page
Contact email: Displayed on bulletin page
Next release: Displayed on bulletin page

Header values must be followed by at least one blank line and the rest of the document is markdown.

Use an H1 line to set the bulletin title, e.g.:

# Producer price inflation

Then use H2 lines to delimit each section, e.g.:

## Introduction

Anything following an H2 tag will be added to the Json as raw markdown and processed when the page renders.

Check your changes in to Github and pretty soon they will be live on Tredegar.
