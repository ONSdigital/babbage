# Bulletin
## Main points
 
 - UK Trade shows the extent of import and export activity and is a key contributor to the overall economic growth of the UK.
 
 - Seasonally adjusted, the UK’s deficit on trade in goods and services was estimated to have been £2.9 billion in February 2015, compared with £1.5 billion in January 2015. This reflects a deficit of £10.3 billion on goods, partially offset by an estimated surplus of £7.5 billion on services.
 
 - The widening of the trade deficit between January and February 2015 mainly reflects a fall in exports of goods to non-EU countries, particularly to the United States. In terms of commodities, the main decreases were in the exports of miscellaneous manufactures, material manufactures and chemical manufactures.
 
 - In the 3 months to February 2015, the total trade deficit narrowed by £0.4 billion to £6.5 billion. The narrowing reflects an increase in goods exported to countries outside the EU; specifically chemicals (up £0.9 billion) and a decrease in goods imported from outside the EU. Exports of services also increased over the same period. The narrowing was partially offset by a fall in exports of goods to the EU.
 
 - In the 3 months to February 2015, the trade in goods deficit between the UK and countries within the EU reached a record high of £21.1 billion, since comparable records began in 1998. The widening of £1.5 billion mainly reflects a 5.6% fall in exports (particularly exports of oil).

## Summary
 The deficit of trade in goods and services for February 2015 widened to £2.9 billion from £1.5 billion in the previous month. The trade position reflects exports minus imports. This widening between January and February is the largest monthly widening since January 2014. Between January and February, exports decreased by £1.0 billion to £41.3 billion and imports increased by £0.3 billion to £44.2 billion.
 
 The deficit on trade in goods was £10.3 billion in February 2015, widening by £1.2 billion from January. Exports fell by £0.9 billion between January and February, whilst imports rose by £0.3 billion over the same period.
 
 In detail, exports of goods fell by £0.9 billion to £23.2 billion in February 2015, the lowest since September 2010. The decrease reflects a £1.1 billion fall in exports of manufactured goods; in particular miscellaneous manufactures (down £0.4 billion) and material manufactures (down £0.4 billion). Fuel exports partially offset the fall in manufacturing exports with an increase of £0.3 billion from January.
 
 Imports of goods rose by £0.3 billion in February 2015, mainly reflecting a £0.4 billion increase in imports of fuels; specifically oil imports (up £0.4 billion) and a £0.2 billion increase in imports of machinery and transport equipment. These increases were partially offset by a £0.2 billion decrease in imports of material manufactures.
 
 Focusing on trade in oil, the monthly deficit on oil was virtually unchanged at £0.7 billion in February 2015. Despite both exports and imports increasing from the previous month, the value of both transactions in the 3 months to February are the lowest for some time; 3 monthly export levels are the lowest since May 2009 and 3 monthly imports are the lowest since March 2010.
 
 In February 2015, exports to countries within the EU fell by £0.1 billion to £11.0 billion. Decreases in almost all main commodities, particularly manufactured goods (down £0.3 billion) were offset by a £0.4 billion increase in the export of fuels. Imports from EU countries fell by £0.1 billion between January and February. Decreases in material manufactures (down £0.2 billion) and chemical manufactures (down £0.1 billion) were partially offset by increases in fuels and machinery and transport equipment.
 
 Outside the EU, exports fell by £0.9 billion. Miscellaneous manufactures fell by £0.4 billion, material manufactures fell by £0.2 billion and chemical manufactures fell by £0.1 billion. These decreases were accompanied by other, less substantial falls in the remaining main commodities. Imports from countries outside of the EU rose by £0.4 billion, reflecting a £0.2 billion rise in the import of fuels.
 
 Trade statistics for any one month can be erratic. For that reason, it is recommended to compare the latest three months against the preceding three months and the same three months of the preceding year.
 
 In the 3 months to February 2015, the trade in goods deficit narrowed by £0.1 billion to £29.4 billion. The narrowing reflects a £1.2 billion fall in exports and a £1.3 billion fall in imports. At the commodity level, the fall in exports over the 3 months to February reflects a £2.2 billion decrease in exports of fuels, which was partly offset by a £1.1 billion rise in exports of chemicals. Over the same period, imports of fuels fell by £2.4 billion and imports of unspecified goods fell by £0.5 billion. Imports of machinery and transport equipment partially offset these falls with an increase of £2.0 billion.
 
 By area, the UK’s deficit with the EU widened by £1.5 billion; mainly reflecting a £2.0 billion fall in exports (in particular, fuel exports, which fell by £1.8 billion) and a £0.6 billion fall in imports (in particular, fuel imports, which fell by £0.7 billion). The UK’s deficit with non-EU countries narrowed by £1.6 billion in the 3 months to February as exports rose by £0.9 billion; £0.9 billion of this increase is attributed to exports of chemicals and £0.6 billion to unspecified goods, partially offset by falls in material manufactures and fuels. Over the same period, imports from countries outside of the EU fell by £0.7 billion; reflecting a £1.7 billion decrease in fuel imports that was partially offset by a rise in machinery and transport equipment.
 
 This bulletin also reports on trade in services. However, the information on trade in services is mainly obtained from quarterly surveys, in some cases underpinned by larger annual surveys. That means that the data for the latest months are inevitably uncertain.
 
 The surplus on trade in services was estimated to be £7.5 billion in February 2015; a £0.2 billion narrowing from the previous month. The slight fall in the surplus reflects a £0.1 billion decrease in exports and a £0.1 billion increase in imports.
 
## Longer-term perspective
 The value of trade in goods grew steadily from the beginning of 2007 to mid-2008. The onset of the global economic downturn in mid-2008 affected the economic performance of the UK’s major trading partners and the value of both UK exports and imports fell sharply until Q2 2009. Growth in the value of trade in goods resumed from mid-2009 with improving global economic conditions.  However, the value of both UK exports and imports has remained largely flat since mid-2011 with the continuing difficulties in many economies.
 
## Revisions
 The total trade balance in January was revised downwards by £0.9 billion from the January 2015 UK Trade release. The revision was primarily due to the value of imports being revised for both goods and services, whilst exports were relatively unchanged. Imports of goods were revised upwards by £0.7 billion in January 2015, due mainly to new data for trade in manufactured goods. Estimates of services imports were revised upwards by £0.2 billion.
 
 Annually, imports of services for 2014 have been revised upwards by £1.6 billion reflecting revisions from ONS International Trade in Services Survey within other business services and telecommunication, computer and information services. These were partially offset by downward revisions to insurance services.

## Trade in goods - geographical analysis
 The UK’s top 5 export trading partners were unchanged in February 2015 when compared with January 2015. An increase in exports to the Netherlands of £0.2 billion and an increase of £17.0 million to France (Table 8), meant the 2 countries switched as the 3rd and 4th largest exporters when compared with January 2015. Outside the top 5, China replaced Belgium and Luxembourg (combined) as the UK's 6th largest export trading partner, due to an increase in exports of £0.1 billion.
 
 Outside the top 10, exports to Greece were at a record low in February 2015 with a fall of £0.1 billion (41.7%) when compared with January 2015. This contributed to a record low trade surplus between the UK and Greece, which stood at £10.0 million in February 2015.
 
 The UK’s top 5 import trading partners were also unchanged in February 2015 when compared with January 2015. Germany remains the UK’s top import trading partner, with imports of £4.9 billion. An increase in imports from China of £0.2 billion led to a record high trade deficit of £2.3 billion in February 2015. Outside the top 5, a £0.1 billion increase in imports sees Norway rise from being the UK's 10th largest import trading partner in January 2015 to the 8th largest this month (Table 8). Anecdotal evidence suggests this was due to an increase in the import of ships and boats.
 
 Outside the top 10, imports from the Czech Republic were at a record high of £0.4 billion, reflecting an increase in imports of passenger motor cars. This increase in imports contributed to the record highest trade deficit between the UK and the Czech Republic of £0.3 billion in February 2015.
 
 In the 3 months ending February 2015, there were record exports to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Exports to Saudi Arabia increased by £0.4 billion to £1.2 billion, contributing to a record high UK trade surplus of £0.8 billion. Exports to the United Arab Emirates increased by £0.2 billion to £1.7 billion.
 
 In the 3 months ending February 2015, there were also record imports from both the Czech Republic and the USA. Imports from the Czech Republic increased by £0.1 billion to £1.3 billion and imports from the USA increased by £0.7 billion to £8.4 billion.

 [Figure 9]-[Chart]
 
### Revisions
 
 Trade in services data have been revised from January 2014.
 
 For 2014, exports of services were revised upwards by £0.1 billion, however there were offsetting revisions throughout the year. 2014 Q4 was revised upwards by £0.6 billion and 2014 Q2 revised downwards by £0.4 billion. For 2014 as a whole financial services were revised upwards partially offset by revisions in transport services. Quarterly Insurance estimates were also revised as a result of updated survey data.
 
 Annually, imports of services for 2014 have been revised upwards by £1.6 billion reflecting revisions from ONS International Trade in Services Survey within other business services and telecommunication, computer and information services. These were partially offset by downward revisions to insurance services.

## [Accordion] Background notes
 
 1. **What's new?**
 
 The UK Statistics Authority [suspended the National Statistics designation of UK Trade](http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/letter-from-sir-andrew-dilnot-to-john-pullinger-141114.pdf "Suspended the National Statistics designation of UK Trade") on 14 November 2014. The Authority's re-assessment of UK Trade against the Code of Practice for Official Statistics is now underway. More details are available from the [Authority's website](http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/assessment/current-assessments/statistics-on-uk-trade.html "Authority's website").
 
 **EMU enlargement**
 
 As of 1 January 2015, Lithuania joined the European Monetary Union (EMU). Therefore the EMU totals in this UK Trade release include Lithuania.
 
 **Related publications**
 
 On 6 February 2015, ONS published an article on the [Rotterdam effect](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/uktrade/uk-trade/december-2014/sty-trade-rotterdam-effect-.html "STY TRADE Rotterdam Effect") and its potential impact on the UK trade in goods estimates.
 
 On 23 January 2015, ONS published a short story exploring [the reasons behind the UK Trade deficit](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/uktrade/uk-trade/november-2014/sty-record-trade-surplus-in-services-partly-offsets-record-trade-deficit-on-goods.html "STY Record Trade Surplus in Services Partly Offsets Record Trade Deficit on Goods").
 
 **Erratics**
 
 Non-monetary gold is now included in the erratics series; along with ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver. In compliance with the BPM6 changes, non-monetary gold which is held as a store of wealth, is now recorded within trade in goods.
 
 **Non-monetary gold**
 
 To comply with international statistical guidelines, we introduced estimates for trade in non-monetary gold and other precious metals into the quarterly national accounts from 30 September 2014, and the monthly UK Trade statistics released on 10 October 2014. In developing these estimates further it had been proposed to use data from a Bank of England (BoE) survey, collecting estimates of physical holdings of gold and other precious metals for the reporting period March 2013 onwards, as described in the article '[Measurement of Non-monetary Gold](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa1-rd/national-accounts-articles/measurement-of-nonmonetary-gold.html "National Accounts articles - Measurement of Non-monetary Gold")' published on 23 January 2014.
 
 However, on receiving the aggregated survey results, the data were volatile with large monthly changes that, despite being on a net trade basis, significantly distorted the estimated monthly trade balance. Due to this volatility and given that the survey is relatively new, having only commenced from the reporting period March 2013, it has been decided to undertake further work to quality assure these data and to review the methods used to measure non-monetary gold and other precious metals more generally. In addition, further disclosure assessment is required to ensure the confidentiality of businesses within the survey is maintained. So, the method used for the series pre-2013, derived from BoE information of gold as a store of wealth by UK MFIs, has been extended with the survey information being used to inform the movements of the later periods, but rescaled to the level of the pre-2013 data.
 
 We will keep users informed of progress and it is likely we will seek views on how best to proceed.
 
 **Revisions**
 
 In this release, periods from January 2014 are open for revision.
 
 2. **Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) Fraud**
 
 Users should be aware that in some periods, the monthly data does not sum precisely to the quarters (or the quarters to the annual), for the MTIC series due to rounding.
 
 **Deflation**
 
 It is common for the value of a group of financial transactions to be measured in several time periods. The values measured will include both the change in the volume sold and the effect of the change of prices over that year. Deflation is the process whereby the effect of price change is removed from a set of values.
 
 Chain-linked indices (chained volume measures) which are indexed to form the volume series in this bulletin differ from fixed base indices in that the growth from one year to the next is estimated by weighting the components using the contribution to value of trade in the immediately preceding year (effectively re-basing every year). This series of annually re-weighted annual growths is then ‘chain-linked’ to produce a continuous series.
 
 The implied price deflators derived by comparing current price data to chained volume measures data are not the same as the price indices published in this statistical bulletin because the former are current weighted while the latter are base (2011) weighted.
 
 Changes in trade associated with VAT MTIC fraud mean that comparisons of volume and prices (both including and excluding trade associated with VAT MTIC fraud) should be treated with a great deal of caution.

 5. **Short guide to UK trade**
 
 Ever since statistics on exports and imports of goods were first collected in 1697, UK trade has been one of the country’s key economic indicators.
 
 All information included in the monthly UK Trade statistical bulletin is on a Balance of Payments (BoP) basis and is seasonally adjusted unless otherwise specified. The release contains tables showing the total value of trade in goods together with index numbers of volume and price, figures analysed by broad commodity group (values and indices) and according to geographical area (values only). In addition the UK Trade statistical bulletin also includes early monthly estimates of the value of trade in services.
 
 Data appearing in the UK Trade statistical bulletin are also used as a direct input into the quarterly Balance of Payments and National Accounts.
 
 **Interpreting the data**
 
 In months where quarterly and 3 monthly ending percentage changes for index data coincide, there may be small differences between the data for methodological reasons. Quarterly data are the indexed form of an underlying constant price (for volume indices) or consistent quantity (for price indices) series. 3 month ending data are the average of the index data in that period.
 
 **VAT Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) fraud**
 
 Import figures for trade in goods include adjustments to allow for the impact of VAT MTIC fraud.
 
 The adjustments to trade in goods relate only to part of the carousel version of VAT MTIC fraud. This fraud leads to under recording of imports as fraudsters import goods from the EU, which they then sell on before disappearing without paying VAT on that sale. The goods are eventually exported. Such exports are declared and are therefore already reflected in the UK’s trade in goods statistics.
 
 Changes to the pattern of trading associated with MTIC fraud can make it difficult to analyse trade by commodity group and by country as changes in the impact of activity associated with this fraud affect both imports and exports. However, the MTIC trade adjustments are added to the EU import estimates derived from Intrastat returns as it is this part of the trading chain that is not generally recorded. In particular, adjustments affect trade in capital goods and intermediate goods–these categories include mobile phones and computer components, which are still the most widely affected goods.
 
 International convention determines that the treatment of the impact is to adjust imports upwards by the relevant amounts of missing declarations (non-response). However, users may wish to interpret short-term movements in imports excluding that part of the fraudulent activity that is not included in the import estimates. For this purpose, an analysis of the import figures with the VAT MTIC adjustments excluded is shown in Table 13.
 
 **Definitions and explanations**
 
 A glossary of terms is published in the [UK Balance of Payments - The Pink Book, 2014](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/bop/united-kingdom-balance-of-payments/2014.html "United Kingdom Balance of Payments - 2014").
 
 **Use of the data**
 
 UK Trade is a key economic indicator due to the importance of international trade to the UK economy. It is also a very timely statistic, providing an early indicator of what is happening more generally in the economy.
 
 In addition, it is a major component of two other key economic statistics: UK gross domestic product (GDP) and the UK Balance of Payments. This means that there is a threefold potential for UK Trade statistics to inform the government’s view of the UK economy, as well as the views of others, such as economists, City analysts, academics, the media and international organisations.

 - late trader data, revisions to trade prices and revised estimates of trading associated with VAT MTIC fraud, and
 
 - revisions to seasonal adjustment factors which are re-estimated every month.
 
 Trade in services estimates have been derived from a number of monthly and quarterly sources. For components where no monthly data are available, estimates have been derived on the basis of recent trends. The results should be used with appropriate caution, as they are therefore likely to be less reliable than those for trade in goods.
 
 **Reliability:** Revisions to data provide one indication of the reliability of key indicators. The table below shows summary information on the size and direction of the revisions which have been made to the data covering a five-year period. A statistical test has been applied to the average revision to find out if it is statistically significantly different from zero. An asterisk (*) shows that the test is significant.
 
 On 9 May 2005, ONS published an article explaining the [past revisions performance for UK Trade statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/uktrade/uk-trade/analysis-of-past-revisions-to-uk-trade-statistics/index.html "Analysis of past revisions to UK Trade statistics") and what is being done to improve the first published estimates, on 9 May 2005.

 HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) publish [Overseas Trade Statistics](http://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/Pages/MonthlyTimetableofReleases.aspx "Overseas Trade Statistics") on the same day as ONS release the UK Trade data each month. The aggregate estimates here will differ slightly from those that are published by the Office for National Statistics as part of the [Balance of Payments](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/bop/united-kingdom-balance-of-payments/2014.html "United Kingdom Balance of Payments - 2014") (BoP), as the two sets of data are compiled to different sets of rules. The BoP publication shows a high level picture of UK trade-in-goods, whereas the OTS publication shows a detailed picture of the UK’s trade-in-goods by commodity and partner country.
