"Business, industry and trade",,,"Statistics about the production and trade of goods and services help us identify patterns and trends in the UK economy. We look at figures on retail sales, business activity, indices for the construction and manufacturing industries and international trade."
,Business,,"We focus on businesses that are registered for VAT or PAYE, which means some very small businesses are not covered. We publish the number of businesses in the UK with regional breakdowns. Business size is based on employment and turnover. Business activity specifies the type of industry."
,,"Activity, size and location","We look at UK businesses broken down by geography, industry, legal status and employment size band. We also examine enterprise levels by turnover size band."
,,Business innovation,"Estimates of Research and Development (R&D) performed in and funded by 4 sectors of the economy. These sectors include Business Enterprise, Higher Education, Government (including Research Councils) and Private Non-Profit organisations."
,,Business services,
,Changes to business,,"We look at how UK businesses are growing, surviving and changing over time. These figures are an informal indicator of confidence in the UK economy."
,,Bankruptcy/insolvency,
,,"Business births, deaths and survival rates","We measure births by looking at the number of businesses that register for VAT or PAYE, and deaths by the number of businesses that have ceased to trade in a given time period. Survival rates measure the percentage of businesses still registered a given number of years after they first registered."
,,Mergers and acquisitions,"A merger is when 2 companies or organisations of a similar size agree to join together to operate as a single company under a new name. An acquisition is when a company buys the shares of a second company which is usually smaller. Other statistics include disposals, that is, when a company or organisation sells or liquidates an asset or a subsidiary."
,Construction industry,,"We look at businesses involved in the construction of new buildings and the repair or alteration of existing properties. Also included are civil engineering companies. The construction industry's output is defined as the amount charged by construction companies for the value of work produced in a given period. Users of construction industry data include central government, Eurostat and industry analysts."
,International trade,,"Goods and services traded across the UK's international borders. These statistics give a breakdown of the types of goods traded and the general trends in international trade. Uses of this data include the UK Trade statistical bulletin, which gives totals of imports and exports."
,It and internet industry,,We take a look at the value and percentage of business sales that take place over the internet. We also measure the percentage of businesses that have a website and broadband connection. These figures allow us to determine the importance of the internet to UK businesses.
,Manufacturing and production industry,,"Manufacturing is the biggest industry in the production sector. This sector includes the mining and quarrying, energy supply and water supply and waste management industries. These statistics are widely used in the private and public sector, particularly by the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility to help with policy and decision making."
,Retail industry,,Businesses which sell goods directly to end-user customers are defined as retailers. The key statistic for retail is the Retail Sales Index (RSI) which is published monthly. Data in the RSI only covers spending on goods (in-store and online). Data on spending on services can be found in the Index of Services (IoS).
,Tourism industry,,"We look at data from the tourism industry, including accommodation services, food and beverage services, passenger transport services, vehicle hire, travel agencies and sports, recreational and conference services. We also examine employment levels and output of the tourism industry, the number of visitors to the UK and the amount they spend."
Economy,,,"The UK economy covers the production, distribution, consumption and trade of goods and services. Individuals, businesses, organisations and governments all affect the development of the economy."
,Economic output and productivity,,"Economic output is the total value of goods and/or services produced in a process. We measure this by using indices of manufacturing, production and services. Productivity is a measure of efficiency, and can be expressed as a ratio of output to input over a given period of time; for example, output per person per hour."
,,Output,"Economic output is the total value of goods and/or services produced, and is an important economic indicator. We measure this using indices including manufacturing, production and services."

,Gross Value Added (GVA),,"This measures the contribution to the economy of each individual producer, industry or sector. We use it to estimate Gross Domestic Product (GDP)."
,Inflation and price indices,,We use price indices such as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) to assess inflation - a measure of the rate of increase in prices for goods and services. One way to understand the CPI is to think of a large shopping basket containing a selection of the goods and services bought by households. The CPI estimates changes to the total cost of this basket.
,"Investments, pensions and trusts",,"Investment refers to the flow of money around and across countries for the purpose of making profit. A pension is a fixed sum to be paid regularly to a person, typically following retirement, and a trust is a legal arrangement where 1 or more 'trustees' are made legally responsible for holding assets. Statistics here include net flows of investment into the UK, figures on the number of people who hold pensions of different types and investments made by various types of trusts. "

They provide an indication of the impact that changes in demographic patterns might have on the size and age structure of the population in the future. These projections are widely used for resource allocation and planning. "
,Well-being,,"Measuring national well-being is about looking beyond what we produce, to areas such as health, relationships, education and skills, what we do, where we live, our finances and the environment.
