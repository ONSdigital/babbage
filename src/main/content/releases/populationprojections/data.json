  "summary": "National population projections are available by age and sex for the UK and its constituent countries. These population projections are based on mid-year population estimates and a set of underlying assumptions regarding future fertility, mortality and migration. They provide an indication of the impact that changes in demographic patterns might have on the size and age structure of the population in the future. These projections are widely used for resource allocation and planning. ",
