This amount represents the income generated by businesses in the UK, less the cost of goods and services used to create this income. \n- Between 2012 and 2013, aGVA increased by 8.1% (£76.3 billion), the largest annual percentage increase since 1997. This increase is a continuation of the recovery seen between 2009 and 2012 and takes aGVA to a level 11.3% (£103.0 billion) above that seen in 2008, at the start of the recession.\n- For the first year since the start of the recession in 2008 all sectors of the UK Non-Financial Business Economy, as measured by the Annual Business Survey (ABS), saw growth in aGVA between 2012 and 2013.\n- The Non-Financial Service sector, which accounts for over half (54.7%) of aGVA in the UK Non-Financial Business Economy, contributed most to the increase in aGVA. The sector’s increase of 9.7% (£48.9 billion) between 2012 and 2013 was the fourth consecutive annual increase, taking it to 25.1% (£111.1 billion) above the level seen in 2008.\n- The Production sector, which accounts for just over a fifth of aGVA in the UK Non-Financial Business Economy, saw an increase in aGVA of 4.7% (£10.0 billion) between 2012 and 2013. The increase sees Production sector aGVA above the level in 2008 for the first time.\n- The Distribution sector, which accounts for just over a seventh of aGVA in the UK Non-Financial Business Economy, also saw an increase in aGVA of 6.5% (£9.3 billion) between 2012 and 2013. This follows two consecutive annual decreases between 2010 and 2012, with the level in 2013 remaining below the level seen in 2008.\n- The Construction sector, which accounts for 7.9% of aGVA in the UK Non-Financial Business Economy, saw an increase in aGVA of 10.7% (£7.7 billion) between 2012 and 2013. This is the third consecutive year of growth, which leaves Construction aGVA £4.9 billion lower than the level in 2008.\n\n"

      "markdown": "Estimate of the size and growth of the UK Non-Financial Business Economy for 2013 as measured by the Annual Business Survey (ABS), are presented in this release. It is the key resource for understanding the detailed structure, conduct and performance of businesses across the UK. The release covers:\n\n- Non-Financial Services (includes professional, scientific, communication, administrative, transport, accommodation and food, private health and education, entertainment services);\n\n- Distribution (includes retail, wholesale and motor trades);\n\n- Production (includes manufacturing, oil and gas extraction, energy generation and supply);\n\n- Construction;\n\n- Parts of Agriculture (includes agricultural support services, forestry and fishing).\n\nTogether these industries represent the UK Non-Financial Business Economy and account for around two thirds of the whole economy of the UK in terms of Gross Value Added. Public administration and defence, public sector health and education, finance and farming make up the difference between the UK Non-Financial Business Economy and the whole economy.\n\nEstimates published in this release include turnover, purchases, approximate Gross Value Added at basic prices (aGVA) and employment costs. All data are reported at current prices (effect of price changes included).\n\nWhere the recession is mentioned it refers to the contraction of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that started in 2008, the year from which a consistent ABS time series is available. For more information about the survey see the background notes.\n\nThe ABS has a wide range of uses: for example, ABS statistics are essential contributors to the [UK National Accounts](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa1-rd/national-accounts-concepts--sources-and-methods/august-2011/uk-national-accounts---a-short-guide.pdf \"UK National Accounts\"), including the measurement of [GDP](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Glossary:Gross_domestic_product_(GDP \"GDP\") , they are supplied to Eurostat to meet the requirements of the European Structural Business Statistics (SBS) Regulation, and are used by the devolved administrations and central and local government to monitor and inform policy development.\n\nThe ABS also recently published its [Exporters and Importers, GB, 2013](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/abs/annual-business-survey/exporters-and-importers--gb--2013/sty-abs-i-e-2013.html \"Exporters and Importers, GB, 2013\") and [Business Ownership in the UK, 2012](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/abs/annual-business-survey/business-ownership-in-the-uk--2012/sty-abs-business-ownership.html \"STY ABS Business Ownership\") releases. For other uses see background note 3.\n\nQuestions often asked of the ABS release are \u0027What is aGVA?\u0027 and ‘How does the measure of aGVA differ from the GVA measure in the National Accounts?’. For an overview of aGVA please see our new infographic [\u0027What is aGVA?\u0027](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/abs/annual-business-survey/2012-revised-results/info-agva.html \"INFO aGVA\"). National Accounts carry out coverage adjustments, conceptual adjustments and coherence adjustments. The National Accounts estimate of GVA uses input from a number of sources, and covers the whole UK economy, whereas ABS does not include farming, financial or public sectors. ABS total aGVA is around two thirds of the National Accounts whole economy GVA because of these differences. For further information on aGVA, see background note 8. There is also a recently published article ‘ [A Comparison between ABS and National Accounts Measures of Value Added’ (462.3 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/quality-and-methods/a-comparison-between-abs-and-national-accounts-measures-of-value-added.pdf \"A Comparison between ABS and National Accounts Measures of Value Added\") which provides more detail.\n\nONS makes every effort to provide informative commentary on the data in this release. Where possible, the commentary draws on evidence from businesses or other sources of information to help explain possible reasons behind the observed changes. However, in some places it can prove difficult to elicit detailed reasons for movements, for example, businesses may state a ‘change in the nature of business activity’. Consequently, it is not possible for all data movements to be fully explained.  3\n\n"

This amount represents the approximate Gross Value Added at basic prices (aGVA) of the UK Non-Financial Business Economy. Between 2012 and 2013 aGVA increased by 8.1% (£76.3 billion); a continuation of the recovery seen between 2009 and 2012. This increase resulted in aGVA reaching £1 trillion for the first time, and was 11.3% (£103.0 billion) above the level seen in 2008, at the start of the recession.\n\nThe main components of aGVA are:\n\n1.Turnover (the main component of income);\n\n2.Purchases (the main component of the consumed goods and services).\n\nThe consecutive annual increases seen in aGVA follow a similar pattern of increases in both turnover and purchases. Turnover increased by 6.8% (£225.6 billion) between 2012 and 2013, while purchases of goods, materials and services increased at a similar rate of 6.9% (£161.0 billion), resulting in an 8.1% growth in aGVA. As with aGVA, turnover and purchases were above levels seen in 2008 at the start of the recession for the third consecutive year (see Figure 1).\n\nThe recession and recovery described by the ABS between 2008 and 2013 is broadly in line with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures published in the National Accounts. Both the ABS aGVA estimates and the latest National Accounts GDP estimates (taken from the [Preliminary Estimate for Q3 2014](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/gva/gross-domestic-product--preliminary-estimate/q3-2014/stb-gdp-preliminary-estimate--q3-2014.html#tab-Economic-Context) \"Preliminary Estimate for Q3 2014\") show a fall between 2008 and 2009 and now four consecutive annual increases from 2009 to 2013 led by the Service sector.\n\nA list of industries which are included in the ABS measure of the UK Non-Financial Business Economy, can be found in background note 8.\n\n### Figure 1: UK non-financial business economy, details of turnover and purchases and resulting aGVA, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 1 - table\n\nFor the first year since the start of the recession in 2008 all sectors of the UK Non-Financial Business Economy, as measured by ABS, saw growth in aGVA between 2012 and 2013 (see Figures 2 and 3).\n\nNon-Financial Services, the largest industry sector of the UK Non-Financial Business Economy contributed most to the increase in aGVA. The Non-Financial Service sector aGVA rose by 9.7% (£48.9 billion) between 2012 and 2013, the fourth consecutive annual increase, taking aGVA to £553.9 billion.\n\nThe Production sector saw an increase of 4.7% (£10.0 billion) in aGVA following a slight fall between 2011 and 2012. This increase sees aGVA for the Production sector at £223.6 billion which is above the £222.5 billion seen in 2008, at the start of the recession, for the first time.\n\nThe Distribution sector experienced an increase in aGVA for the first time in three years, with a rise of 6.5% (£9.3 billion) between 2012 and 2013. This increase took aGVA to £153.4 billion, which is still below the £157.8 billion seen in 2008.\n\nThe Construction sector experienced growth in aGVA for the third consecutive year, increasing by 10.7% (£7.7 billion) from £72.2 billion in 2012 to £79.9 billion in 2013. However, as with the Distribution sector, aGVA still remains below the level seen in 2008 (£84.8 billion).\n\nThe Agriculture (part), forestry and fishing sector experienced the largest percentage rise in aGVA of all the sectors, with a 28.4% (£0.4 billion) increase between 2012 and 2013. At £1.8 billion, aGVA for the industry is now above the level seen in 2008 for the first time.\n\n\n### Figure 2: UK non-financial business economy, details of aGVA by sector, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 2 - chart\n\n\n### Figure 3: UK non-Financial business economy, details of aGVA growth by sector, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 3 - chart\n\n"

      "markdown": "Over half (54.7%) of the estimated aGVA total of £1,012.6 billion in 2013 for the UK Non-Financial Business Economy was generated by the Non-Financial Service industries.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2013 Non-Financial Service turnover increased at a higher rate than purchases, 7.0% (£74.9 billion) compared to 5.6% (£31.3 billion). Together with a rise in stock levels and changes in subsidies and taxes, this resulted in aGVA rising by 9.7% (£48.9 billion). This is the fourth consecutive year of growth in aGVA for the sector, following the fall between 2008 and 2009. Turnover, purchases and aGVA are now well above the level seen in 2008 at the start of the recession (see Figure 4).\n\n### Figure 4: Non-financial services, details of turnover and purchases and resulting aGVA, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 4 - chart\n\nAll of the industry sections within the Non-Financial Service sector continued to see increases in aGVA between 2012 and 2013 (see Figures 5 and 6). \n\nThose industries which have made the largest contributions to growth are:\n\n- Professional, scientific \u0026 technical activities (Section M),\n\n- Administrative \u0026 support service activities (Section N),\n\n- Information \u0026 communication (Section J),\n\n- Arts, entertainment \u0026 recreation (Section R), and\n\n- Transport \u0026 storage (Section H).\n\nThese industries, which together accounted for an increase in aGVA of £30.7 billion, are described in more detail after Figure 5b.\n\n### Figure 5a: Non-financial services, details of aGVA by section, 2013\n\nfigure 5a - chart\n\n### Figure 5b: Non-Financial Services, details of aGVA by section, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 5b - chart\n\n\n### Professional, scientific \u0026 technical activities (Section M)\n\nTurnover in Professional, scientific \u0026 technical activities increased by 9.9% (£20.6 billion) between 2012 and 2013, with purchases showing an increase of 13.9% (£12.5 billion). This resulted in growth of 8.6% (£10.3 billion) in aGVA, resulting in aGVA remaining above that reported for 2008 for the third consecutive year.\n\nThis broad section, which covers a range of industries from Legal \u0026 accounting activities to Advertising \u0026 market research and Veterinary activities, saw increases in aGVA in almost all its divisions between 2012 and 2013. Those having the largest impact on aGVA growth were Legal \u0026 accounting activities (Division 69) and Architectural \u0026 engineering activities; technical testing \u0026 analysis (Division 71) which between them contributed £8.3 billion to the increase in aGVA. However, Scientific Research \u0026 Development (Division 72) showed a decrease of £1.5 billion in aGVA over this period which may be due to lack of investment in research since the economic downturn.\n\n### Administrative \u0026 support services (Section N)\n\nBetween 2012 and 2013 Administrative \u0026 support services saw turnover rise by 8.9% (£15.4 billion), while purchases increased by 9.0%  (£7.7 billion) leading to an aGVA increase of 9.5% (£8.3 billion).\n\nThe main industries contributing to growth within Administrative \u0026 support services were Office administrative, office support \u0026 other business support activities (Division 82) where aGVA increased by 14.1% (£2.8 billion).  Employment activities (Division 78) also made a substantial contribution with an 8.9% (£2.3 billion) increase in aGVA.\n\n### Information \u0026 communication (Section J)\n\nTurnover in Information \u0026 communication increased by 4.6% (£8.8 billion) between 2012 and 2013 which, coupled with a smaller 3.5% (£3.4 billion) increase in purchases, resulted in an increase in aGVA of 6.7% (£6.3 billion) between 2012 and 2013.\n\nThe main division causing the growth in aGVA within this section was Computer programming, consultancy \u0026 related activities (Division 62), with an increase of 14.8% (£5.9 billion) between 2012 and 2013. This increase could be attributed to growth in the UK games industry.\n\n### Arts, entertainment \u0026 recreation (Section R)\n\nTurnover in Arts, entertainment \u0026 recreation increased by 8.4% (£9.3 billion) between 2012 and 2013, while purchases increased by 5.4% (£4.9 billion) leading to a 35.6% (£5.9 billion) rise in aGVA. This growth was driven by Gambling \u0026 betting (Division 92) where aGVA increased by a significant 64.9% (£3.4 billion). The growth in this industry is likely to be due to the types and geographical spread of the interactive entertainment industry.\n\n### Transport \u0026 storage (Section H)\n\nTurnover in Transport \u0026 storage increased by 4.2% (£6.3 billion) between 2012 and 2013, with purchases rising by 0.5% (£0.5 billion) resulting in a 9.0% (£5.8 billion) increase in aGVA.\n\nThe main divisions contributing to aGVA growth within Transport \u0026 storage were Land transport \u0026 transport via pipelines (Division 49), and Warehousing \u0026 support activities for transportation (Division 52). Increases in this sector may be related to the effect of the internet economy. Data on the retail sector indicates that turnover from mail order and via the internet continued to increase at a higher rate than turnover from shops. An increase seen in Warehousing \u0026 support activities for transportation is likely to partly result from the storage of items ordered from the internet.\n\n### Figure 6: Non-financial services, details of aGVA growth by section 2008-2013\n\ntable 6\n\n"

      "markdown": "The Production sector in 2013 provided just over a fifth (22.1%) of the estimated aGVA total of £1,012.6 billion for the UK Non-Financial Business Economy.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2013 Production sector turnover and purchases increased by 2.7% (£18.9 billion) and 3.1% (£14.3 billion) respectively. Together with rises in stock levels and changes in taxes, this led to an increase in aGVA of 4.7% (£10.0 billion), which followed a slight fall between 2011 and 2012. The increase sees Production sector aGVA above the level in 2008, at the start of the recession, for the first time (see Figure 7).\n\n### Figure 7: Production, details of turnover and purchases and resulting aGVA, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 7 - chart\n\nManufacturing (Section C), which contributes 70% of Production sector aGVA, saw a rise in aGVA of 5.8% (£8.6 billion) between 2012 and 2013, and was the main reason for overall growth.\n\nOver the same period the other sections in the Production sector: B (Mining \u0026 quarrying), E (Water \u0026 waste management) and D (Energy generation \u0026 supply), also saw increases in aGVA of 2.9% (£0.7 billion), 2.2% (£0.4 billion) and 1.1% (£0.3 billion) respectively (see Figures 8 and 9).\n\n\n### Figure 8: Production, details of aGVA by section, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 8 - chart\n\n### Figure 9: Production, details of aGVA growth by section, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 9 - chart\n\n#### Manufacturing (Section C)\n\nThe divisions contributing nearly half (46.3%) of Manufacturing aGVA are (see Figure 10):\n\n- Manufacture of food products (Division 10),\n\n- Manufacture of Fabricated metal products, except machinery \u0026 equipment (Division 25),\n\n- Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers \u0026 semi-trailers (Division 29),\n\n- Manufacture of Machinery \u0026 equipment n.e.c. (Division 28), and\n\n- Manufacture of other transport equipment (Division 30).\n\n### Figure 10: Manufacturing, details of aGVA by division, 2013\n\nfigure 10 - table\n\nBetween 2012 and 2013 Manufacturing saw increases of 1.8% (£9.1 billion) in turnover and 1.2% (£4.1 billion) in purchases which, together with rises in stock levels and changes in taxes, contributed to an increase in aGVA of 5.8% (£8.6 billion). \n\nThe increase in Manufacturing aGVA was mainly in:\n\n- Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers \u0026 semi-trailers (Division 29),\n\n- Manufacture of other transport equipment (Division 30),\n\n- Manufacture of food products (Division 10),\n\n- Repair and installation of machinery and equipment (division 33), and.\n\n- Manufacture of basic metals (Division 24).\n\nTogether these five divisions contributed £8.3 billion to the overall £8.6 billion increase in Manufacturing aGVA (see Figures 11 and 12).\n\nAccounting for a third of the overall manufacturing growth was Manufacture of motor vehicles,  trailers \u0026 semi-trailers (Division 29), where the aGVA increase of £2.9 billion can be largely attributed to the increase in sales and, in particular, export of high-end vehicles and also hybrid cars.\n\nNew overseas contracts awarded to businesses in Manufacture of other transport equipment (Division 30) contributed to the aGVA increase of £2.2 billion.\n\nAcross Manufacturing almost two thirds (17 out of 24) of the divisions contributing to this sector experienced increases in aGVA between 2012 and 2013.\n\nOther reasons cited by businesses as contributing to the rise in Manufacturing aGVA were businesses restructuring, the take-over of a similar business, the gaining of new contracts and reduction in purchases.\n\nThe 48.6% (£1.0 billion) decrease in aGVA for Manufacture of coke \u0026 refined petroleum products (Division 19) is caused by the level of duty paid on oil refining. Due to the small size of this division in terms of Manufacturing aGVA, annual changes should be viewed with care.\n\n### Figure 11: Manufacturing, details of aGVA growth by division, 2012-2013\n\nfigure 11 - chart\n\n### Figure 12: Manufacturing, details of aGVA percentage growth by division, 2012-2013\n\nfigure 12 - chart\n\n### Other production (Sections B, D-E)\n\nThis sector consists of Mining \u0026 quarrying (Section B, which includes oil and gas extraction), Energy generation \u0026 supply (Section D) and Water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation activities (Section E). The sector saw increases in turnover and purchases of 5.3% (£9.9 billion) and 8.3% (£10.3 billion) respectively, which resulted in an increase in aGVA of 2.0% (£1.3 billion).\n\nThe industry contributing the most to this growth was Mining \u0026 quarrying.\n\n### Mining \u0026 quarrying (Section B, Which includes oil and gas extraction)\n\nTurnover in Mining \u0026 quarrying increased by 3.4% (£1.7 billion) while purchases increased by 9.2% (£2.5 billion). Together with increases in work of a capital nature, this resulted in a 2.9% (£0.7 billion) rise in aGVA.\n\nThe main contributor was Other Mining and Quarrying (Division 08) where the increase in aGVA was generally attributed to increased margins and procurement savings and also an increase in demand for business.\n\n### Energy Generation \u0026 Supply (Section D)\n\nElectricity generation \u0026 supply also saw an increase between 2012 and 2013. Turnover increased by 5.5% (£5.8 billion) and purchases by 7.1% (£5.8 billion), which together with rising stock levels resulted in an aGVA increase of 1.1% (£0.3 billion). \n\nReasons given for this increase were a growth in business in onshore/offshore wind and offshore gas and price increases for gas and electricity.\n\nThe continuing population rise of micro-businesses (with less than 10 people in employment) in this sector is thought to be due to the growth of small producers of renewable energy encouraged by various green grants, subsidies and \"feed in tariffs\". Between 2012 and 2013 the number of micro-businesses in this area increased by 42.5% (to over 2,300).\n\n"

This contributed to the increase in aGVA of 6.5% (£9.3 billion). This is the first annual increase since 2010, with aGVA for the Distribution sector at its highest level since the start of the recession in 2008 (see Figure 13).\n\n### Figure 13: Distribution, details of turnover and purchases and resulting aGVA, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 13 - chart\n\nIncreases in aGVA were seen in all three divisions within Distribution (see Figures 14 and 15), with the largest increase between 2012 and 2013 seen in Retail (excluding Motor Trades - Division 47).\n\n### Figure 14: Distribution, details of aGVA by division, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 14 - chart\n\n#### Retail (excluding motor trades) (Division 47)\n\nRetail aGVA saw an increase of 7.3% (£5.4 billion) between 2012 and 2013.  This growth in aGVA was a result of a 2.9% (£10.2 billion) increase in turnover and a smaller 2.1% (£5.9 billion) increase in purchases.\n\nThe increases in aGVA were driven by an 8.9% (£1.7 billion) rise in Retail sale in non-specialised stores (Group 47.1) which includes retail sales in super-stores and department stores.\n\nReports from businesses continued to indicate that turnover from mail orders and via the internet increased at a higher rate than turnover from shops.  Although increasing, retail sales from mail order and the internet remains a small share of total turnover.\n\n#### Wholesale (excluding motor trades) (Division 46)\n\nWholesale experienced an increase in turnover of 11.0% (£96.7 billion) and purchases of 11.3% (£91.2 billion) between 2012 and 2013 which resulted in an increase in aGVA of 5.1% (£2.5 billion).\n\nThe rise in aGVA between 2012 and 2013 was driven by Wholesale on a fee or contract basis (Group 46.1), which showed an increase of £1.4 billion.\n\n#### Motor trades (wholesale and retail) (Division 45)\n\nBetween 2012 and 2013 both purchases and turnover increased again, by 7.2% (£8.7 billion) and 6.2% (£8.9 billion) respectively. This resulted in aGVA increasing by 6.6% (£1.5 billion), following a decrease last year.\n\nWithin Motor Trades, Sale of motor vehicles (Group 45.1) contributed most to the growth with a 9.6% (£1.1 billion) increase in aGVA between 2012 and 2013. This increase comes after a slight fall of 0.4% (£0.1 billion) in aGVA between 2011 and 2012.\n\n### Figure 15: Distribution, details of aGVA growth by division, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 15 - chart\n\n### Notes for Distribution Industries, Section G\n\n**1.

      "markdown": "The Construction Industries `contributed 7.9% to the estimated aGVA total of £1,012.6 for the UK Non-Financial Business Economy in 2013.\n\nConstruction turnover increased by 8.0% (£15.1 billion) between 2012 and 2013 with purchases increasing by 7.9% (£9.2 billion) to give overall growth in aGVA of 10.7% (£7.7 billion). This is the third consecutive year of growth, which leaves Construction aGVA £4.9 billion lower than the level in 2008, before the recession (see Figure 16).\n\n### Figure 16: Construction, details of turnover and purchases and resulting aGVA, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 16 - chart\n\nAs in the previous year, the growth in Construction was mainly in Construction of buildings (Division 41), see Figures 17 and 18. However, the other two divisions within Construction also contributed to the rise for 2013; aGVA in Civil engineering (Division 42) rose by 12.7% (£1.6 billion) and Specialised construction activities (Division 43) increased by 3.4% (£1.2 billion).\n\n### Figure 17: Construction, details of aGVA by division, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 17 - chart\n\n### Construction of buildings (Division 41)\n\nConstruction of buildings, which was the main cause for the growth in the Construction sector, experienced an increase in aGVA of 19.1% (£4.9 billion) between 2012 and 2013. This was a result of a 13.3% (£9.9 billion) increase in turnover and a 14.1% (£6.7 billion) increase in purchases, coupled with a 417% (£1.8 billion) rise in stock levels.\n\nAs was the case in 2012, this year’s main reason for the increase in aGVA was in the Development of building projects (Group 41.1).\n\n### Figure 18: Construction, details of aGVA growth by division, 2008-2013\n\nfigure 18 - chart\n\n### Notes for construction industries, Section F\n\n1. Please note that the ABS figures for the Construction industries should not be compared directly with annual figures in the monthly ‘Output in the Construction Industry’ release because:\n\n- the ABS figures cover the United Kingdom, while the \u0027Output in the Construction Industry\u0027 covers Great Britain only;\n\n- the two surveys measure different concepts of this industry;\n\n- while both quote figures for a calendar year, the ‘Output in the Construction Industry’ are based on the aggregate of the responses to 12 monthly surveys, whereas ABS figures are based on annual responses covering a range of business years;\n\n- the ABS figures will always be larger than those in the ‘Output in the Construction Industry’ because the latter excludes: Property developers (SIC 41.1); Payment on purchased services (architects, technical engineering, etc.); Payment to subcontractors, unless the subcontractors are not classified to construction and therefore are not part of the survey; Value of land; Value of materials sold (which are not part of a structure); and Fixtures, equipment and tools that are sold;\n\n- the ABS figures include secondary activities related to businesses classified within the construction sector, while the ‘Output in the Construction Industry’ covers only the construction activity of the businesses.\n\n"

      "markdown": "The ABS covers only hunting, forestry, fishing and the support activities to agriculture. Commentary is therefore limited because the sector’s size in terms of economic output, as measured by the ABS, is small in comparison to the other sectors of the UK Non-Financial Business Economy. However, data for these parts of Section A can be found in the reference tables linked to this bulletin.\n\nNote that the values quoted below for Section A are in **£ millions**.\n\nThe part of Section A covered by ABS showed rises in turnover of 23.7% (£852 million) between 2012 and 2013 and in purchases of 18.6% (£441 million) which led to an increase of 28.4% (£399 million) in aGVA between 2012 and 2013. The main contributor to this increase was Support activities to agriculture \u0026 post-harvest crop activities (Group 01.6).\n\nThis rise means that, at £1,804 million, aGVA is now higher than the level in 2008, at the start of the recession.\n\nComparable GVA figures for the rest of Agriculture (which includes crop and animal production) are available in Chapter 3 (Table 3.2) of the [Agriculture in the United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/agriculture-in-the-united-kingdom \"Agriculture in the United Kingdom\") release published annually by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and shows a value of £9,222 million for 2013. \n\n"

The responding businesses provide information such as their turnover, purchases, employment costs, capital expenditure and stocks.\n\nApproximately 11,000 businesses in Northern Ireland are sampled by the Department of Finance and Personnel Northern Ireland and contribute to the UK estimates.\n\nIn this National Statistics publication, a range of estimates are published including turnover, purchases, approximate Gross Value Added at basic prices (aGVA) and employment costs for industry sectors and the UK Business Economy. All data are reported at current prices (effect of price changes included).\n\nVisit the [ABS webpages](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/index.html \"Annual Business Survey\") for more in-depth information about the ABS, plus the latest news on survey changes and developments.\n\nAn [ABS Glossary of terms (345.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/quality-and-methods/annual-business-survey--glossary-of-terms.pdf \"Annual Business Survey: Glossary of Terms\") is available to help interpret the technical descriptions and abbreviations used throughout this bulletin. \n\n2. **ABS quality information**\n\nA [Quality and Methodology Information (QMI)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/quality-information/business-statistics/quality-and-methodology-information-for-annual-business-survey--abs-.pdf \"Quality and Methodology Information for Annual Business Survey (ABS)\") report for the ABS can be found on the ONS website. The aims of the QMI report are to provide users with a greater understanding of ONS’s statistics, their uses and the methods that are used to produce them. \n\nThe ABS is a sample survey. As with all estimates obtained from sample surveys, ABS estimates are subject to various sources of error. The total error in a survey estimate is the difference between the estimate derived from the data collected and the true (unknown) value for the population. The total error consists of two main elements; the sampling error and the non-sampling error. The ABS was designed to minimise both these errors. The standard error is the estimated value of the sampling error. The estimate for a variable, plus and minus the standard error for the variable, gives a range in which the true unknown value for the population might lie. The closer the standard error is to 0, the more reliable the estimate.\n\nThe coefficient of variation is the standard error of a variable divided by the survey estimate, and it is used to compare the relative precision across surveys or variables. The closer the coefficient of variation is to 0, the more reliable the estimate. Standard errors and coefficients of variation for turnover, aGVA, purchases and employment costs are available in the quality measures table published with this release.\n\nFor the first time ABS is able to publish [Standard Errors and Coefficients of Variation for the regional data (365 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/abs/annual-business-survey/2012-regional-results/rft-abs-regional-qm.xls \"RFT ABS Regional QM\"). Information about the methodology used in their calculation can be found in the [Standard Errors for Regional Annual Business Survey Data (2.2 Mb Word document) report.](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/quality-and-methods/standard-errors-for-regional-annual-business-survey-data.doc \"Standard Errors for Regional Annual Business Survey Data\")\n\nMore detailed information on these and other quality and methodology issues is available in the ABS Technical Report published on the [ABS webpages.](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/index.html \"Annual Business Survey\")\n\n**Selective editing**\n\nWhen ABS responses are received, checks are undertaken to ensure the information is correct. This is known as editing and validation. Selective editing was used to validate responses for the first time for the 2011 results using software called SELEKT. SELEKT is a generic selective editing tool which highlights responses which appear to be in error if they fall outside the range of what is expected and have a large influence on key estimates. Those responses with the highest score are prioritised for editing and validation. This increases the efficiency of the editing process by focusing on the responses with the highest impact and importance.\n\nThe introduction of selective editing should at least maintain, if not improve the quality of the ABS results as it should: minimise the bias introduced by processing (removing over-editing); remove non-value adding activities from the process; and focus resources to errors that impact on the results.\n\nHowever, the full impact on quality is not yet known. This will continue to be monitored and any updates will be included with future ABS releases. For more information on SELEKT, see Chapter 5 of the [ABS Technical Report (1.68 Mb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/quality-and-methods/abs-technical-report---june-2014.pdf \"ABS Technical Report - June 2014\"). \n\n3. **Uses and users of ABS statistics**\n\nABS outputs may be used to answer questions such as:\n\n- how much wealth has been created in a particular industry?\n\n- has there been a shift in activity from one industrial sector to another, and which industry groups/classes/subclasses are driving the change?\n\n- are any industries particularly dominant in specific regions or countries of the UK and are there structural changes over time?\n\n- how productive is a particular industry, such as the chemicals sector, and what is its operating profitability?\n\nABS data for 2012 recently contributed data to stories about the [manufacturing](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/uncategorised/summary/changing-shape-of-uk-manufacturing/sty-facts-about-manufacturing-in-the-uk.html), [aerospace](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/uncategorised/summary/changing-shape-of-uk-manufacturing---aerospace/sty-uk-aerospace-industry.html) and [textile](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/uncategorised/summary/changing-shape-of-uk-manufacturing---textiles/sty---textile-industry-average-wage-lowest-within-uk-manufacturing.html) industries\n\nThere are a wide range of users that view, download and utilise the ABS data. Key users of the output include:\n\nNational Accounts: The statistics produced help to improve the overall quality of the UK National Accounts and the measurement of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The ABS forms a major data input to the production of [Input-Output Annual Supply and Use Tables](http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/economy/national-accounts/supply-and-use-tables \"Input-Output Annual Supply and Use Tables\") used to set the annual level of UK GDP. The Supply and Use tables show the sales and purchases relationships between consumers and producers by industry (see chapter 2 of [UK National Accounts, Blue Book 2011 edition](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa1-rd/united-kingdom-national-accounts/2011-edition/bod---blue-book-2011.pdf \"UK National Accounts, Blue Book 2011 edition\")).

We would welcome any feedback you might have, and would be particularly interested in knowing how you make use of these data to inform your work. Please contact us via email: [abs@ons.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:abs@ons.gsi.gov.uk) or telephone Jon Gough on +44 (0)1633 456720.\n\nThe Changing Shape of UK Manufacturing, an event coordinated jointly with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), took place in October 2014.

To view the content of the day, please visit [Storify](https://storify.com/ONS/changing-shape-of-manufacturing-in-the-uk). \n\n5. **ABS revisions**\n\nABS estimates are revised in line with the ABS Revisions Policy. The revisions policy is available in the [ABS Technical Report (1.68 Mb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/quality-and-methods/abs-technical-report---june-2014.pdf \"ABS Technical Report - June 2014\") to assist users with their understanding of the cycle and frequency of data revisions. Users of this release are strongly advised to read this policy before using the data for research or policy related purposes.\n\nPlanned revisions usually arise from either the receipt of additional data or the correction of errors to existing data by businesses responding to the ABS. Those of notable magnitude will be highlighted and explained.\n\nRevisions to published ABS regional results for the previous reference year can be expected in the latest reference year’s data release.\n\nAs an example of the timing and scale of revisions, provisional regional data for 2011 were first published in July 2013 and included Insurance \u0026 reinsurance industries (part of Section K). The revised results for 2011 in this July 2014 release exclude Insurance \u0026 reinsurance industries. The revision to aGVA between these two regional releases, comparing the UK  Business Economy to the UK Non-Financial Business Economy, is -6.2% (-£60.3 billion). If Insurance \u0026 reinsurance industries are removed from the July 2013 release, the revision to aGVA falls to -2.2% (-£20.7 billion).\n\nRevisions to data provide one indication of the reliability of key indicators. A table showing the size of revisions is published alongside the statistical bulletin released in June each year.\n\nAll other revisions will be regarded as unplanned and will be dealt with by non-standard releases. All revisions will be released in compliance with the same principles as other new information. \n\n6. **International comparisons** \n\nInternational comparisons of structural business statistics are available from Eurostat (for the European Union), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD):\n\nEurostat: analysis of Structural Business Statistics.\n\n[OECD](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/organisations/organisation-for-economic-co-operation-and-development--oecd-.html \"Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)\") : follow the link to the structural analysis database, under the industry and services theme. \n\n7. **Response Rates and Compliance Costs** \n\nThe figures in this release are based on an annual survey of businesses. Provisional 2013 results are based on a response rate of 75.3%. Response rates by different sectors can be found in the Quality Measures (794.5 Kb Excel sheet)   accompanying the UK Non-Financial Business Economy, 2012 Revised Results, with a summary provided in Table 1.\n\n### Table 1: UK non-financial business economy (Part) 1 - Response rates by sector\n\ntable 1\n\nFor an estimate of the cost to GB businesses for providing their data to the ABS (known as compliance cost) see appendix B of the [ONS Compliance Plan. (215.7 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/get-involved/taking-part-in-a-survey/information-for-businesses/compliance-and-simplification-plans/compliance-plan-2011-12.pdf \"Compliance Plan  2011/12\")\n\n8. **General Information** \n\nThese points should be noted when using ABS results\n\n**ABS coverage**\n\nThe results in this Statistical Bulletin represent approximately two-thirds of the UK economy in terms of Gross Value Added. In previous releases the UK Business Economy has been referred to as the Whole Economy.\n\nThe industries covered are:\n\n- Agriculture (support activities SIC 01.6 and hunting \u0026 trapping 01.7 only), forestry and fishing - Section A;\n\n- Production - Sections B-E;\n\n- Construction - Section F;\n\n- Distribution - Section G;\n\n- Non-Financial Services - Sections H, I, J, L, M, N, P (private provision only), Q (private provision only in SIC 86.1 and 86.9), R and S.\n\nThe main industries excluded are:\n\n- Agriculture (SIC 01.1, 01.2, 01.3, 01.4 and 01.5 in Section A);\n\n- Financial and insurance (Section K);\n\n- Public administration and defence (Section O);\n\n- Education (public provision in Section P);\n\n- Health (SIC 86.2, public provision in SIC 86.1 and 86.9 in Section Q).\n\nData for a small part of the Financial and insurance sector (Insurance and reinsurance only (SIC 65.1 and 65.2)) has been collected by the ABS since 2008 and was previously included in the results. This was the only part of Financial and Insurance Activities (Section K) covered by the survey. As with any new time-series, estimates for these industries have remained experimental while ongoing quality assurance has taken place. This quality assurance has led the figures to be revised substantially in recent years with a resulting break in the series between 2009 and 2010. Following discussions with key users, ONS decided to remove this experimental series from ABS releases for the reference year 2012 onwards due to the continued volatility of the data. The estimates for this series have been removed from releases since November 2013 to allow for a more detailed quality assessment to be undertaken. The removal of these series does not affect other industries published as part of this release and has no impact on any other financial statistics published by ONS.\n\nA review of the questionnaire for Insurance and Reinsurance businesses will be undertaken, alongside continued validation of returns to the survey, with the aim of reintroducing them to the ABS publications when the quality of the data has improved. Updates on progress will be available on the [ABS News Pages](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/abs-news/index.html \"ABS News\").\n\n**Standard Industrial Classification**\n\nABS results are classified according to the [Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities (SIC) system.](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/standard-industrial-classification/index.html \"UK Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (UK SIC 2007)\") The UK is required by European legislation to have a system of classification consistent with the European Union’s industrial classification system. The system underwent a major review in 2007. ABS data have been collected and published on the SIC 2007 system since the reference year 2008. Other revisions to the system occurred in 1958, 1968, 1980, 1992, 1997, and 2003.\n\nUK SIC 2007 is divided into 21 sections, each denoted by a single letter from A to U. Each section can be uniquely defined by the next breakdown, the divisions (denoted by two digits). The divisions are then broken down into groups (three digits), then into classes (four digits) and, in several cases, again into subclasses (five digits). So for example we have:\n\nsection  C  manufacturing (comprising divisions 10 to 33) \ndivision   13 manufacture of textiles \ngroup   13.9 manufacture of other textiles \nclass    13.93 manufacture of carpets and rugs subclass  13.93/1   manufacture of woven or tufted carpets and rugs\n\nThe full structure of SIC 2007 consists of 21 sections, 88 divisions, 272 groups, 615 classes and 191 subclasses in SIC 2007.\n\n**Structural changes to businesses** \n\nThe business economy is constantly evolving as businesses merge, are taken over, or simply change the main focus of their business. These changes can result in the industry classification of a business changing over time. For example, if a business undertakes both manufacturing and wholesale activities, but most of its employment is within manufacturing, it will be classified to manufacturing. If the employment were to change substantially so that the majority worked in wholesale then the industry classification would change and the whole of the businesses turnover, for example, would move from manufacturing to wholesale. In industries where movements are common, or where large businesses are involved, these changes can themselves sometimes cause large changes in ABS estimates. This should be taken into consideration when changes over time are being assessed.\n\n**Calculation of Gross Value Added Estimates** \n\nApproximate Gross Value Added at basic prices (aGVA) is derived from the responses of businesses to questions asked on the ABS. It is a measure of the income generated by businesses, industries or sectors, less the cost of goods and services used to create the income. The main component of income is turnover, while purchases is the main component of the consumed goods and services. Stock levels which may rise or fall can also have an impact on aGVA, as can the values of subsidies received or duty paid. Businesses\u0027 labour costs (for example, wages and salaries) are paid from the value of aGVA, leaving a gross operating surplus (or loss) which is a good approximation for profit (or loss). The cost of capital investment, financial charges and dividends to shareholders are met from the gross operating surplus.\n\naGVA is calculated in basic prices. That is, the valuation of output includes net taxes (taxes minus subsidies) on production, such as business rates, but not net taxes on individual products that result from the production process, such as Value Added Tax (VAT).\n\nEstimates of turnover and purchases from the ABS are used to produce estimates of output and intermediate consumption (and therefore GVA) in the National Accounts. However, many other sources (including surveys and administrative sources) are also used to produce National Accounts estimates. These include sources of data on taxation and inventories (which are preferred to the ABS as they are used consistently throughout all parts of the National Accounts), as well as own-use output and non-market output (as these activities are only partially covered by the ABS).\n\nThere are differences between the two measures of gross value added in terms of coverage. For example, GVA covers the whole of the UK economy while aGVA covers the UK Non-Financial Business Economy, a subset of the whole economy that excludes large parts of agriculture, all of public administration and defence, publicly provided healthcare and education, and the financial sector.\n\nThere are conceptual differences between the two measures of gross value added. For example, some production activities such as illegal smuggling of goods must be included in the National Accounts but are outside the scope of the ABS.\n\nThere are three approaches to measuring GDP; one based on production activity, one based on expenditure, and one based on income. In theory, the three approaches should produce the same estimate of GDP. However, in practice this is never the case because the three approaches make use of different data sources, each with their own definitions and limitations. The three different estimates are therefore reconciled in a process known as Supply and Use balancing. The balancing process is informed by a variety of data sources, and results in adjustments to estimates of output and intermediate consumption. For many industries, the balancing adjustment is the greatest source of difference between estimates from the ABS and the National Accounts.\n\nMore detailed information of the differences between aGVA and GVA is available in the [ABS Technical Report (1.68 Mb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/quality-and-methods/abs-technical-report---june-2014.pdf \"ABS Technical Report - June 2014\")   published on the [ABS webpages](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/index.html \"Annual Business Survey\").

The ABS does not collect employment level information so instead this key information is taken from another source. In the past, employment data were collected via the Annual Business Inquiry / Part 1 (ABI/1), however, in 2009, ABI/1 was replaced with the Business Register and Employment Survey (BRES). The ABS and BRES are both optimal for their respective purposes, however caution should be taken when combining the financial data from the ABS and employment information from BRES to calculate estimates due to differences in methodology. More information on the differences between ABS and BRES is available in the [ABS Technical Report (1.61 Mb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/quality-and-methods/abs-technical-report.pdf \"Annual Business Survey Technical Report - August 2012\") published on the [ABS webpages](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/index.html \"Annual Business Survey\"). \n\n9. **Disclosure control and symbols used**\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to suppress figures for certain items in order to avoid disclosing information about an individual business. Further information on why data are suppressed is available in the [ONS Disclosure Control Policy (337 Kb Word document)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/best-practice/disclosure-control-policy-for-tables/disclosure-control-policy-for-tables-produced-from-surveys.pdf \"Disclosure Control Policy for Tables Produced from Surveys\")  or in the [ABS Technical Report (1.68 Mb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/quality-and-methods/abs-technical-report---june-2014.pdf \"ABS Technical Report - June 2014\")  .\n\nThe following symbols are used throughout the ABS releases:\n\n\\*     information suppressed to avoid disclosure. \n\\.\\.     not available. \n\\-      nil or less than half the level of rounding.\n\n10. **What’s new?** \n\nManufacturing aGVA growth charts (Figures 11 and 12) show amount and percentage of aGVA growth for each division in Manufacturing.\n\n11. **National Statistics** \n\nThe United Kingdom Statistics Authority reviewed ABS outputs in their report [“Assessment of compliance with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics: Statistics from the Annual Business Survey – Assessment Report 180”](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/stats-authority/uk-statistics-authority--assessment-of-the-annual-business-survey.html \"UK Statistics Authority: Assessment of Annual Business Survey\") .\n\nFollowing the ABS response to the report the UK Statistics Authority have since designated these statistics as National Statistics, in accordance with the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 and signifying compliance with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.\n\nDesignation can be broadly interpreted to mean that the statistics:\n\n- meet identified user needs;\n\n- are well explained and readily accessible;\n\n- are produced according to sound methods, and\n\n- are managed impartially and objectively in the public interest.\n\nOnce statistics have been designated as National Statistics it is a statutory requirement that the Code of Practice shall continue to be observed.\n\n12. **Social media**\n\nFollow ONS on [Twitter](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/ons-twitter.html \"ONS Twitter\") and receive up to date information about our statistics.\n\nLike ONS on [Facebook](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/index.html \"Facebook\") to receive our updates in your newsfeed and to post comments on our page.\n\nWatch our videos on [YouTube](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/youtube.html \"Youtube\").\n\n13. **Government Statistical Service (GSS) Business Statistics**\n\nTo find out about other official business statistics, and choose the right data for your needs, use the [GSS Business Statistics Interactive User Guide](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/understanding-ons-statistics/business-statistics---interactive-user-guide/index.html \"GSS Business Statistics  - interative user guide\").
