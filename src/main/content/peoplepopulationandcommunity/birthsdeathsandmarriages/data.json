    "title": "Births, deaths and marriages",
    "summary": "Births, deaths and marriages or ‘life event’ statistics allow us to have a better understanding of the size and condition of the population.  The number of births and deaths affect the size of the usual resident population.  Definitive data on the number of births and deaths are published on a calendar year basis, whereas data for updating population estimates use mid-year to mid-year (1 July to 30 June) data, with some other minor differences.
