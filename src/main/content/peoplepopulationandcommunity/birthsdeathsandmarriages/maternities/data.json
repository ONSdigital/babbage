  "summary": "A maternity is a pregnancy resulting in the birth of one or more children, including stillbirths. Multiple births arising from a single pregnancy are counted as one maternity, therefore the number of maternities indicates the number of women having babies rather than the number of babies born. Here you can find the latest figures on the number of maternities in England and Wales. ",

The number of births and deaths affect the size of the usual resident population.  Definitive data on the number of births and deaths are published on a calendar year basis, whereas data for updating population estimates use mid-year to mid-year (1 July to 30 June) data, with some other minor differences.
