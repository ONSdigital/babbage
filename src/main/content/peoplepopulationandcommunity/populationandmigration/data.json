    "summary": "Population and migration statistics describe the size, age, sex structure and geographic distribution of the UK population. They also consider changes to the UK population and the factors driving these changes. These statistics have a wide range of uses; they are used by central government, local government and the health sector for planning, resource allocation and managing the economy. Additionally, they are used by a wide range of people such as market researchers, academics and those in special interest groups."
