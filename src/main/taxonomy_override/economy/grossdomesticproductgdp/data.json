GDP can be expressed in nominal or real terms. Nominal GDP reflects the value of all the goods and services which are produced in the UK during a given period, using their price at the time of production.",
  "more": "Real GDP also reflects the value of produced goods and services, but it uses constant consumer and producer price indices to remove the effects of rising price levels (inflation). Periods of real GDP growth are thought to enhance the welfare of individuals as economic growth allows average incomes to rise, supporting a higher level of consumption. Periods of negative real GDP growth are associated with lower incomes, lower consumption and consequently a lower standard of living.",
