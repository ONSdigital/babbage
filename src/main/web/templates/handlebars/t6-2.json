Not all sectors can have all types of account, so the numbering is not necessarily consecutive within each sector’s chapter. The rest of the world’s identified components of accounts 2-6 inclusive are given in a single account numbered 2. UK whole economy accounts consistent with ESA 2010 are given in section 1.6 (816.5 Kb Excel sheet) as a time series and in section 1.7 (816.5 Kb Excel sheet) in detailed matrix format with all sectors, the rest of the world, and the UK total identified."
