{{!--
This template forms a base configuration for all chart types, this is included in client side as javascript source file. 
It is used to render highchart configuration and attach it to window object when run in a browser. Since Highcharts configurations are javascript objects it is not possible to read complex chart configurations ( objects with functions as members) as json objects, that is why it has to be rendered dynamically as a javascript source file.
The chart configurations are used both by Babbage and Florence, thats why it is rendered on server side using handlebars to make it possible to edit configuration without the need of rebuilding.
