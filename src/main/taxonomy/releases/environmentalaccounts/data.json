  "lede": "Environmental Accounts show the relationship between the environment and the economy. This is done by outlining how the environment contributes to the economy (e.g. through the extraction of raw materials), the impact the economy has on the environment (e.g. through energy consumption) and how society responds to environmental issues (e.g. through expenditure on environmental protection). These accounts are used to inform government policies and to evaluate the impact that different sectors have on the environment.",
