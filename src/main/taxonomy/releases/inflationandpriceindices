  "lede": "Inflation measures the rate of increase in prices for goods and services using price indices. The rate of inflation used in the UK government\u0027s inflation target is measured using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). One way to understand the CPI is to think of a very large shopping basket containing a large selection of the goods and services bought by households, the CPI estimates changes to the total cost of this basket.",
