  "lede": "Producer Price Inflation (PPI) measures the price changes of goods bought and sold by UK manufacturers this month compared to the same month a year ago. PPI provides a key measure of inflation alongside other indicators such as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Services Producer Price Index (SPPI).PPI is split into two components: output price inflation and input price inflation. The input price indices capture changes in the cost of the material and fuel inputs that producers face whereas the output price indices capture the changing prices of goods sold by producers.This article looks at the trends in both producer price indices since 2000 and which components contribute most towards changes in each price index in recent years.",
  "more": "Annual output and input price changes follow similar trends, but with the latter tending to have higher price growth1. In Figure 1, trends in producer price inflation can be split into three distinct periods: 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2012 and 2012 to June 2014.  Both indices experience greater variability within the second period of 2005 to 2012 than compared with the first and third period. From 2005 to 2012 the average growth rate was 2.9% for output price inflation and 8.1% for input price inflation.  The largest peaks and troughs experienced for both indices throughout the time series shown below occurred in the second period of 2005 to 2012. Output price inflation rose to 8.9% in July 2008 while input price inflation rose to 34.8% in June 2008 and both fell to their lowest rates in July 2009: output price inflation falling by 1.6% and input price inflation falling by 14.8%.",

      "summary": "This release provides estimates of R\u0026D performed in and funded by the following four sectors of the economy, as defined in the ‘Frascati Manual’: Business Enterprise (BERD), Higher Education (HERD), Government (GovERD), which includes Research Councils, and Private Non-Profit (PNP) organisations. All these sectors’ R\u0026D data are known collectively as GERD, which represents the gross domestic expenditure on R\u0026D in the UK. GERD is unique in providing this information, and is the preferred measure of R\u0026D activity for use in international comparisons. This release reports on R\u0026D expenditure in the UK irrespective of the residence of the ultimate owner or users of the R\u0026D produced. The main purpose of collecting R\u0026D data from all sectors of the economy is to supply data for policy and monitoring purposes on science and technology, of which R\u0026D is an important part.",
