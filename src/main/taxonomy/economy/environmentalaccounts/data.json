They include natural capital accounts (oil and gas), physical accounts (fuel use, energy consumption, atmospheric emissions, material flows, and water), and monetary accounts (environmental taxes and environmental protection expenditure). For 2014, experimental natural capital accounts (land use and forestry) are also included.",
